# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is project 002 in the "appydave-app-a-day" series - a simple prompt collection for image generation comparing different AI models' prompt styles.

## Repository Structure

- `prompts/` - Contains text files with image generation prompts
  - `dog-fox-leonardo.txt` - Concise, technical prompts optimized for Leonardo AI
  - `dog-fox-openai.txt` - Descriptive, narrative prompts optimized for OpenAI DALL-E

## Prompt Format

Each prompt file contains numbered sequences (1→, 2→, etc.) that tell a visual story. The prompts are designed to generate a series of related images that form a narrative sequence.

Leonardo prompts focus on technical parameters (cinematic lighting, 16:9 aspect ratio, specific art styles), while OpenAI prompts emphasize descriptive storytelling and natural language.
